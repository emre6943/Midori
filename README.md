# A quick introduction to our app...
This is gr33n, an app that makes aiding the environment more fun. Our goal with this app is to make helping our world enjoyable, and socially interactive. 

After you create an app account you can choose items from a list, which you want to do (or have done) to help environment. Those items may include, but are not limited to; Riding a bike to work instead of a car, eating vegetarian meals, reducing power usage of your devices/appliances, and so on. The app will also give you tips to help stimulate and inform you about making a "greener" choice. Based on your (vehicle, food or appliance) input, the app can calculate your CO2 emissions, after which it will show you just how easy it is to make a change yourself; You can save energy, CO2, and naturally: money, with just a couple of clicks!

But that's not all: each person's "stats" can be shared and displayed from their gr33n profile. 
Which means you can compete with your friends while saving the world! What's more heroic?

### Personal Development Plan

I think outside of the box, I am okay under stressful positions.I always try to be cool when I am stressed for example algorithm implementation, I set there for 3 hours even though it was going bad.I guess I will be good about giving ideas and relaxing people. I give up to fast, and sometimes I am not good at focusing. I always wonder to other things, and I gave up so many of the things I start. I guess it is bad for the team but because we are team those kinds of things will be fine. I would like to improve my programing and team working, even though we know java I don’t know how will we make a app and how 6 people will work together. I am really excited to put out a fully working app. Right now I am excited and I will be working for this project, and I also tried to make my app but I kinda got lost on the way. I feel like I would like to work mostly on database and server part of this app, I don’t like coding the look of the app. First we will get use to git and then I guess we will divide the work to data java and server and work in smaller groups. But we could also work as a big group one by one too. I am really excited that we will produce an actual app that will work hopefully, and get  a 9, 10.

### Personal Development Plan

#### What are your two strong points?

One of my strongest points is my affinity to graphical design and design in general. I think I can do a good job on front-end development.
A second strong point would be my ability to communicate ideas in a simple manner, which can make interactions with the team easier and more effective.

#### What are two of your weaker points?

I lack experience in programming and I am not the best at organising my time efficiently, that would be my main weaknesses.

#### Do you have examples of this?

During the previous quarter, I had to drop a course to be able to pass the other two due to poor time management  and organisation.

#### What is your learning goal during this course?

My main goal is to learn to work in a team and develop software from the bottom up.

### Personal Development Plan

My focus during this project will be to utilize my strengths as much as possible to help the team 
be as successful as possible, as well as trying to strengthen my weaknesses as much as possible. 

If I were to list my strengths and weaknesses, I would say that I am willing to put in as much time as 
it takes to get something done. In addition to that I see myself as being very organized. Matters with 
high importance should be dealt with as soon as possible and those with less importance should be dealt with 
as the opportunity represents itself.

One of my two biggest weaknesses would be my lack of knowledge and experience regarding programming as group and 
programming as a whole. The second would be the fact that presenting is not really one of my strong points.
I set my learning goal to be trying to soak up as much experience as possible, so that future projects will 
be even more successful. I plan to achieve this by learning from my fellow teammates. 
The only thing that might be hindering this would be dedication we have to give to the remaining two courses this quarter. 
Nonetheless I and I am sure that my teammates as well, will give as much as we can to make sure the project is a success.

### Personal Development Plan

#### What are two of your strong points?
I’m a really good presenter and can speak very well in front of a big audience.  I work very hard.
Do you have examples of this?
Presenting: I have presented in front of an audience consisting of 400 people when I was 14 years old.
Since I live far away from Delft, and because I do want to continue with this course I stay back till 9:00 PM to study.
How is this point shown in a team?
Presenting is one of the things we have to do at the end of the project. Hence, I think this skill is an important.
For working hard, this project requires rigorous amount of work to be done which can only be handled by a hard worker.
#### What are two of your weaker points?
Cannot handle stress
Working in team 
##### Do you have examples of this?
During the OOP exam I panicked and started shivering which caused me to score bad.
Usually, depending on how my team would be in the past. I would either work alone and take the responsibility if my team was horrible. In other scenario if my team was really good I would have a little input. Therefore, now I would love to improve in being balanced. 
How is this point shown in a team?
#### G - Goal
What is your learning goal during this course?
I would love to improve my skills on web and a bit on java.
Do you have multiple? List them seperately
Make sure your learning goal is concrete.
Why is this important to you
This goal is important to me because this is major part of this whole project.
When will you have succeeded in achieving this goal?
When I learn,understand and implement the parts I’ve been asked to implement without anyone’s help.
#### R - Reality (Your current situation)
Are you actively working on your goal?
Not as if now, because I have just started the project. I first have to get through by the week 1 assignment.
What is going well?
What can use improvement?
#### O - Options (Look at possible options)
##### What are options you have to achieve your goal?
Firstly, I read through all the material and watch lecture videos to concretely get through. Secondly, I’ll practise by using going through the assignments and implement them myself.
##### Which option do you want to use the most?
Reading through the material, as understanding things are more important first, then only you can go ahead implementing everything.
##### What is stopping you reaching your goal?
The current README task.
#### W - Will (Motivation, plan of action)
##### What are you going to do to reach your goal?
Like I mentioned earlier, I’m going to do this by getting my basics clear and then practise.
##### When are you going to do this?
As soon as this is done I’ll get on with achieving these goals.
##### What is the first concrete step you can take RIGHT NOW?
Nothing
##### How can your teammates help you achieve this goal?
They can explain and try answering everything I ask them to.
Can you make an action plan with concrete steps to help you achieve your goal?
Week 1: Try to finish all the web lectures because I have already kind of started studying web, and I’m left with 2 more lectures so achieving this goal should be doable. Also watch 4-5 lecture videos.
Week 2: Continue watching other lecture videos and start implementing exercises alongside start working on the actual OOP project.

### Personal Development Plan

#### *My strong points?*

I am pretty flexible/adaptable, if something unexpected happens; I can almost always find some solution, even if it’s an unconventional means to an end (you could call it thinking outside-of-the-box I suppose). The second one would have to be communication/social maneuvering; I try to listen to what other people have to say, add some of my own perspectives, elicit responses that progress towards a better (yet middle-ground) solution, and so forth. Those things should not be a problem. 

#### *My weak points?*

First weak point: I can be the embodiment of chaos/the unfocused; Some days I am so scattered that not even I can make sense of the ideas I am trying to say/convey. Which means I might just come across as completely lost or "out of it" (But of course I hope it does not get that bad).

Second weak point: Due to this lack of focus, it is sometimes hard for me to motivate myself to do anything I feel has no direct application, value or goal. As that would just feel like extra “noise” to my brain, to such a degree that I have trouble remembering a lot of things. (Coincidently the root of another, more productive, trait of mine: I am always in looking for a more effective and more efficient solution). This can make me an inconsequent person too, because I sometimes fail to see the bigger picture (in case of far-future-related scenarios). Pretty safe to say I am not really a consistent person either: How evident my weak and/or strong traits are, really depends on the moment.

#### **So what is my goal?**

Since chaos seems to be prevalent in my life, I would really like to learn the art of delivering a genuinely good product (something which, relative to my habits, requires a lot of organisation and structure). After all: creativity is best conveyed with some structure. Therefore; I would like to observe what it takes to be efficient as a team, how it feels to face challenges with that team and what it takes to build a product you are honestly satisfied with. I would like to witness the workings of a well-directed and well-combined force. People are power, let us work together to create something amazing.
