# Sprint Review

## Main problems  Encountered

### Problem 1: A lot of problems setting up heroku 
Due to a lot of problems with the versions the of libraries and the dependencies in the pom.xml file, 
setting everything up so that it would compile took a whole lot of time.

### Problem 2: Couple of issues with the database
Although we had the code for the database set up, it was not working for some reason. We ask a TA for help.

## Adjustments from previous sprints
- We have been meeting regularly to to discuss what need to be done
- We divided the roles in a good manner, by the end of the week most of the points we set out to do 
on our agenda were done.

## Adjustments for next sprint
 - Increase testing effort
 - Add cake rule
