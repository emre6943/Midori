# Main problems  Encountered
                                     
## Problem 1: Testing
During our demo we got critiqued on not having our tests sorted and for not having our checkstyle
in order. We fixed that and were are going to make sure that doesnt happen in the future.

                                     
## Problem 2: ScumBoard
Due to Klodi being absent and him being in chqrge of scrum we fell behind q bit. But now that he 
is back we fixed it and got back on track with it
                                     
## Adjustments from previous sprints
Just continue with the tests and make sure we dont fall behind on documentation.
