# Main problems  Encountered
                                     
## Problem 1: Server Problems 
 Server can't keep the connection once client sends something, it cannot send a second request without 
 refreshing the connection. We asked our TA for help, and we will try to fix it.
                                     
## Problem 2: Not staying up to date
 Even though we are good and upto date in app, we aren't really up to date with the the administrative side of things
 such as the coverage, checkstyle checkstyle report etc. This happened because one of our members had some 
 personal problems. However, now that we know the problems we will be giving these issues more attention.
                                     
## Adjustments from previous sprints
 We will work on the small things and focus on temporary solutions if we have bigger things to do.
                                     
                                     
## Adjustments for next sprint
 We will stay up to date on every expect
