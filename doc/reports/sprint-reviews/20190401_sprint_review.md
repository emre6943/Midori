# Main problems  Encountered
                                     
## Problem 1: Jacoco

We had some issues getting jacoco to properly, we could not get to properly generate a report. We will try to get 
it done before the next meeting.
                                     
## Problem 2: GUI

We were behind on the gui, so around the end of the week we had to rush everything and work on the gui to finish it.
So at the moment we only have a functional gui and not a very asthethic one.
                                     
## Adjustments from previous sprints
Just continue with the tests and make sure we dont fall behind on documentation.
