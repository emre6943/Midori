# Sprint Review

## Main problems  Encountered

### Problem 1: Setting up git, sourcetree, and intellij

We started off with a lot of problems, git, sourcetree were very problematic to set up. Eventually we 
got everyone on git, although it took too long to set up.

## Adjustments for next sprint
 - Good role division
 - Regular meetings
